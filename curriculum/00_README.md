# 📚 Curriculum Templates (Student-Facing)

## 📘 Overview

This folder contains the **standardized SQL curriculum templates** used for all batches.  
Each template is designed to ensure uniformity, clarity, and reusability across all student groups.

Only this folder (`curriculum/`) is **visible to students** — while instructor automation and setup scripts remain hidden.

## 🧰 Instructor Workflow

When a new batch is created using:

```bash
bash docs/scripts/create_batch.sh 21
```

the script automatically copies:

- The entire curriculum template structure from here
- All required setup files (`batches/<batch_no>/week_01/day_01/00_get_started/`)
- The macOS installer (`install_mac.sh`)

This ensures each batch (`/batches/<batch_number>/`) begins with:

- Consistent folder naming
- Ready-to-use setup materials
- Clean separation between instructor and student content
